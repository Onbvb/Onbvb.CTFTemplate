## This is a basic example of a CTF system.

This is to be copied and edited to your heart's content.

Note:
There is a property in the system under "Extras" to denote this as a CTF system, the CTF logic will only work in systems with this enabled.
```
 "extras": {
        "CTFInfo" : {
            "isCaptureTheFlagSystem" : true
        }
    }
```
TODO:
Edit this repo when done with flag logic.
